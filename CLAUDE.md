# qbit-template-extension

GitHub template repository for scaffolding QQQ "Extension QBits" (infrastructure-level plugins: table customizers, auth, audit, action wrappers). Not a shipping library — consumers click "Use this template" and rename the `com.kingsrook.qbits.example` package.

Reviewed at commit `e7d4b4d672cc` (branch `main`, 2026-05-21). Known drift as of that review: no `qbit-build-parent` parent pom (org convention), qqq pinned at 0.35.0 on main (0.40.0-SNAPSHOT on develop), README still claims AGPL-3.0 while LICENSE/NOTICE are Apache-2.0, and README references `scripts/customize_template.py` / `actions/ExampleActionCustomizer.java` which do not exist. See the dossier's "Maturity & risks" and "v4.0 impact" sections before modifying the scaffold.
